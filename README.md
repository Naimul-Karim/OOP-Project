# OOP-Project
# 🧮 Java Console Calculator

A simple, menu-driven calculator built in Java using object-oriented principles. This calculator performs basic arithmetic, advanced mathematical operations, and trigonometric functions — all in a user-friendly console environment.

## 📌 Project Purpose

This project aims to develop a versatile calculator that:
- Helps users perform a wide range of calculations through the terminal
- Demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java
- Encourages structured, readable, and maintainable code

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/) with error handling for divide-by-zero

### ✅ Advanced Math
- Modulus (%)
- Exponentiation (^)
- Square root (`sqrt`) with validation
- Factorial (non-negative integers only)

### ✅ Trigonometry
- Sine (`sin`)
- Cosine (`cos`)
- Tangent (`tan`) with checks for undefined values

### ✅ Other Features
- Menu-driven user interface

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Component         | Description                  |
|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Language**     | Java                         |
| **IDE**          | IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse      |
| **Libraries**    | No external libraries used   |

## 🚀 OOP Concepts in Action

| Principle      | Usage Example                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Operations are modularized using methods for clarity and data hiding      |
| **Abstraction**   | Users interact with menu options; internal logic is hidden from the user   |
| **Polymorphism**  | Used in methods like factorial or future extensibility (e.g., overloading) |
| **Inheritance**   | Planned for next phase to separate logic into reusable class hierarchies   |

## 📆 Project Timeline (Planned)

| Phase                     | Description                              | Est. Time |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Planning & Design        | Define structure, features, menus        | 1 Day     |
| Core Implementation      | Build calculator logic                   | 2–3 Days  |
| OOP Refactoring          | Separate logic into classes              | 2 Days    |
| UI Improvements (optional)| GUI with Swing or JavaFX                | TBD       |
| Testing & Polishing      | Edge case handling, cleanup              | 1 Day     |
